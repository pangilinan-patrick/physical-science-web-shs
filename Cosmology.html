				<p style="font-weight:bold;">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</p>
				<p>In physical cosmology, Big Bang nucleosynthesis (or primordial nucleosynthesis) refers to the production of nuclei other than H-1, the normal, light hydrogen, during the early phases of the universe, shortly after the Big Bang.</p>
				<p style="font-weight:bold;">Stellar Formation and Evolution</p>
				<p>Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular clouds in interstellar space, sometimes referred to as "stellar nurseries" or "star-forming regions", collapse and form stars.</p>
				<p style="font-weight:bold;">Stellar Explosion or Supernova</p>
				<p>Stellar evolution is the process by which a star changes over the course of time. Depending on the mass of the star, its lifetime can range from a few million years for the most massive to trillions of years for the least massive, which is considerably longer than the age of the universe.</p>

			<p class="subtitle">Big Bang Theory</p>
			
			<div id="mainp">
				<p>The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law (the farther away galaxies are, the faster they are moving away from Earth).</p>
			</div>
			
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">Stages of the Big Bang Theory:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Singularity</li>
					<p>A point in space and/or a moment in time where the universe was infinitely hot and dense.</p>
					<li>Inflation</li>
					<p>Is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the early universe. The inflationary epoch lasted from 10<sup>-36</sup> seconds.</p>
					<li>Nucleosynthesis</li>
					<p>Is the process that creates new atomic nuclei from pre-existing nucleons, primarily protons and neutrons.</p>
					<li>Recombination</li>
					<p>Refers to the epoch at which charged electrons and protons first become bound to form electrically neutral hydrogen atoms.</p>

			<p class="subtitle">Cosmic Microwave Background</p>
			
			<div id="mainp">
				<p>The cosmic microwave background (CMB, CMBR) is electromagnetic radiation as a remnant from an early stage of the universe in Big Bang cosmology. In older literature, the CMB is also variously known as cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) or "relic radiation". The CMB is a faint cosmic background radiation filling all space that is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the epoch of recombination.</p>

			<p class="subtitle">All About Atoms</p>
			
			
			<div id="mainp">
				<p>Atoms are the smallest unit of matter that have all the properties of an element. They are composed of smaller subatomic particles as <b>protons, neutrons, and electrons.</b></p>
				
				<p style="font-weight:bold;">Isotopes</p>
				<p>Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number, and consequently in nucleon number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos and topos, meaning "the same place"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table.</p>
				
				<p style="font-weight:bold;">Ions</p>
				<p>An ion is an atom or molecule that has a non-zero net electrical charge. Since the charge of the electron (considered "negative" by convention) is equal and opposite to that of the proton (considered "positive" by convention), the net charge of an ion is non-zero due to its total number of electrons being unequal to its total number of protons. A cation is a positively charged ion, with fewer electrons than protons, while an anion is negatively charged, with more electrons than protons. Because of their opposite electric currents, cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic compounds.</p>
