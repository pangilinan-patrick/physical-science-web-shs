        <p>
          In physical cosmology, Big Bang nucleosynthesis (or primordial
          nucleosynthesis) refers to the production of nuclei other than H-1,
          the normal, light hydrogen, during the early phases of the universe,
          shortly after the Big Bang.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">Stellar Formation and Evolution</p>
        <p>
          Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular
          clouds in interstellar space, sometimes referred to as "stellar
          nurseries" or "star-forming regions", collapse and form stars.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">Stellar Explosion or Supernova</p>
        <p>
          Stellar evolution is the process by which a star changes over the
          course of time. Depending on the mass of the star, its lifetime can
          range from a few million years for the most massive to trillions of
          years for the least massive, which is considerably longer than the age
          of the universe.

          The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the
          observable universe from the earliest known periods through its
          subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe
          expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state, and
          offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena,
          including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave
          background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law (the farther
          away galaxies are, the faster they are moving away from Earth).

          The cosmic microwave background (CMB, CMBR) is electromagnetic
          radiation as a remnant from an early stage of the universe in Big Bang
          cosmology. In older literature, the CMB is also variously known as
          cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) or "relic radiation". The
          CMB is a faint cosmic background radiation filling all space that is
          an important source of data on the early universe because it is the
          oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the epoch
          of recombination.

      <div id="mainp">
        <p>
          Atoms are the smallest unit of matter that have all the properties of
          an element. They are composed of smaller subatomic particles as
          <b>protons, neutrons, and electrons.</b>
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold">Isotopes</p>
        <p>
          Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in
          neutron number, and consequently in nucleon number. All isotopes of a
          given element have the same number of protons but different numbers of
          neutrons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots
          isos and topos, meaning "the same place"; thus, the meaning behind the
          name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same
          position on the periodic table.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold">Ions</p>
        <p>
          An ion is an atom or molecule that has a non-zero net electrical
          charge. Since the charge of the electron (considered "negative" by
          convention) is equal and opposite to that of the proton (considered
          "positive" by convention), the net charge of an ion is non-zero due to
          its total number of electrons being unequal to its total number of
          protons. A cation is a positively charged ion, with fewer electrons
          than protons, while an anion is negatively charged, with more
          electrons than protons. Because of their opposite electric currents,
          cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic
          compounds.
