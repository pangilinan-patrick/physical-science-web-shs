          In nuclear physics, nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more
          atomic nuclei are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei
          and subatomic particles (neutrons or protons). The difference in mass
          between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release
          or absorption of energy.

        <p>
          Stellar evolution is the process by which a star changes over the
          course of time. Depending on the mass of the star, its lifetime can
          range from a few million years for the most massive to trillions of
          years for the least massive, which is considerably longer than the age
          of the universe.

          Stellar nucleosynthesis is the theory explaining the creation
          (nucleosynthesis) of chemical elements by nuclear fusion reactions
          between atoms within stars. Stellar nucleosynthesis has occurred
          continuously since the original creation of hydrogen, helium and
          lithium during the Big Bang.

          Fred Hoyle in 1954. The nucleosynthesis, or fusion of lighter elements
          into heavier ones, occurs during explosive oxygen burning and silicon
          burning.

          Supernovae are more energetic than novae. In Latin, nova means "new",
          referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright
          star. Adding the prefix "super-" distinguishes supernovae from
          ordinary novae, which are far less luminous. The word supernova was
          coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931.

        <p>
          The rapid neutron-capture process, or so-called r-process, is a set of
          nuclear reactions that in nuclear astrophysics is responsible for the
          creation (nucleosynthesis) of approximately half the abundances of the
          atomic nuclei heavier than iron, usually synthesizing the entire
          abundance of the two most neutron-rich stable isotopes of each heavy
          element. Chemical elements heavier than iron typically are enabled by
          the force between nucleons to be capable of six to ten stable isotopic
          forms having the same nuclear charge Z but differing in neutron number
          N, each of whose natural abundances contribute to the natural
          abundance of the chemical element. Each isotope is characterized by
          the number of neutrons that it contains.
